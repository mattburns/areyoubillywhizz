This software allows you to connect your stackmat to your pc.

It connects via the serial port on your pc, also known as the comm port.

It talks the stackmats protocol, RS-232, which is how the competition timers work.

It is currently windows only, but I may make it platform independent one day (wouldn't take much).

This software should just work for everyone so if it doesn't I'd be interested to hear why and I'll fix it!
